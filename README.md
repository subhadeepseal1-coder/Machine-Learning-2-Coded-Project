# Machine-Learning-2-Coded-Project
EasyVisa
Course: Machine Learning - 2
This project involves developing machine learning models to predict visa approval outcomes for the OFLC. By analyzing applicant data and identifying key influencing factors, we aim to streamline the visa approval process, optimize resource allocation, and improve decision-making accuracy. The ML models will provide valuable insights into applicant profiles, enabling OFLC to prioritize cases and make informed recommendations for visa certification or denial.

Skills & Tools Covered:

Bagging
Boosting
Stacking
Data Pre-processing
Model Tuning
Cross Validation
Sampling
Hyperparameter tuning
My Learnings:
üìä 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Learned how to explore and interpret applicant data (e.g., education, job title, wage, employer) to identify patterns influencing visa approval outcomes. Gained skills in identifying data quality issues, trends, and correlations between features and the target variable. ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Data Pre-processing & Sampling: Gained hands-on experience with: Handling missing values Encoding categorical variables Balancing imbalanced datasets using techniques like oversampling/undersampling. Ensured the dataset was model-ready by cleaning and transforming variables appropriately. üß† 3. Ensemble Learning Techniques: Applied and compared multiple ensemble models for prediction, including: Bagging (Random Forest) Boosting (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost) Stacking (combining base learners and meta-models) Understood the differences in bias-variance tradeoffs across ensemble methods. üîç 4. Model Evaluation & Tuning: Used Cross Validation to ensure robust model performance across different data folds. Evaluated models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC. Performed Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV) to optimize model performance. üß™ 5. Business Interpretation & Strategy: Identified key predictive features that influence visa approval or denial, such as: Job level Offered wage Employer credibility Previous application outcomes Translated these insights into strategic recommendations for streamlining the visa processing pipeline and prioritizing high-likelihood cases. üí° Overall Takeaway: Learned how to build, tune, and interpret advanced ensemble machine learning models to predict critical outcomes. This project enhanced my ability to combine technical modeling with business impact, enabling better decision-making for high-stakes government processes like visa approvals.
